# Description:
   <p>
       This is a banner grabbing tool designed for red team penetration testers in cybersecurity. It connects to a target IP and port to retrieve service banners, which often reveal useful information such as software type, version, and operating system. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities during the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking. Built in Go for speed and simplicity, It is easy to run, supports both IPs and domain names, and displays clean outputâ€”making it a handy tool for quick network scans and information gathering.
